# Expense-Tracker
Hi, there! This app's main purpose is for me to practice Javascript.

Functionality-wise,
- This app will enable a user to quickly type in an expense record (optionally use a date picker) and submit it into a table
- When typing in an expense record, the user will be able to use the Tab key to jump to each input area
- Each record will have a Delete button
